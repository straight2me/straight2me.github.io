				<h3>Support us</h3>
				<p>We here at Straight2.me honor simplicity, quality, and integrity. Unfortunately, we have found these values to be lacking in the <i>other</i> email services that are out there. The good news is that we have come up with a solution. We have put a lot of time into creating and developing Straight2.me to reflect the key values of what we believe should be natural privileges for every email user. Why shouldn't these values be reflected in email? You deserve a simple interface. You deserve an effortlessly neat inbox. And most importantly, you deserve privacy. Our dream is to provide you with these privileges and to make your dream come true with Straight2.me</p>
				<h4>work effortlessly</h4>
				<p>Dealing with email has never been so easy. View new email expanded and respond quickly with inline replies. View attachments are done with a simple click of a button. Message threads are pleasant to the eyes and don't cause confusion. Quick access to pinned emails allows you to focus on getting things done rather than focus on finding and organizing your emails. We endeavour to making your email management simple and easy by adhering to the Keep It Super Simple principle (K.I.S.S.).</p>
				<h4>take control</h4>
				<p>Organizing email is as simple as a drag and drop of an email. When an email is dropped on a badge (icon on left), a filter is automatically set up. When any new emails come in they will be redirected to the appopiate badge. With all you emails automatically redirected and organized, you don't have to have a seperate email account for your work, family, school, friends, etc. Working in one badge allows you to be more focused on the task at hand without being distracted. When new emails come into a new badge a small notification will appear notifying you if you choose to check the new email.</p>
				<h4>feel safe</h4>
				<p>Modern email can be thought of like sending a postcard. All your information is in the clear for anyone to read who is forwarding that postcard to it's destination. Emails are sent in clear text and sent from router to router to it's final destination. Anyone along that route can take a peek at the contents of you your email. The solution that some people use to protect their information is by using encryption. However, encryption can be hard to setup for some. Also, encryption requires both the sender and the recipient to have encryption set up. This is no longer a problem. Straight2.me handles the set up of the encryption for you. No hassle and your privacy in tact.</p>
				<p class="pull-right"><br>We have made it this far, but we need your help to continue to make a wonderful product.</p>
